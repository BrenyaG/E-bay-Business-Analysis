"E-Bay" Superstore Sales Analysis

**Executive Summary**

This report analyzes the factors driving the high volume of returned orders at the "e-Bay" Superstore. Our primary goal is to help stakeholders better understand the root causes behind customer returns and identify opportunities to reduce return rates.  We explored return patterns by product category, geographic region, and seasonal trends. 

First, we investigated whether a correlation existed between total sales and total returns, using product subcategories as our basis. Our analysis revealed that higher sales do notnecessarily result in higher returns at the "e-Bay" Superstore.  Categories like appliances, chairs, and copiers demonstrated a higher return rate as sales increased.

Next, we assessed return rates by subcategory and examined how frequently individual customers were returning items. This was done to help identify patterns in customer behavior. Geographic analysis highlighted that California, Utah, Oregon, and Washington were the states with the highest return activity.  This offers further insight into location-based trend.

Lastly, we determined the role of seasonality by analyzing return rates by month and explored whether certain times of the year saw more returns. We also looked at how these seasonal trends aligned with overall sales and regional return volumes.  We report that the months with highest returns were August, September, October, and December.

While the data reveals important trends, fully understanding the underlying causes of returns requires additional information—such as customer feedback, shipping and inventory data, and return policy details. It's likely that a combination of factors—product quality, customer expectations, operational inefficiencies, pricing strategy, and return policies—contribute to the issue.


**Overview**

This project analyzes the high number of returned orders at a superstore to identify patterns, causes, and actionable recommendations to reduce return rates. 
Using data analytics, we explored return trends across product subcategories, geographical regions, customer profiles, and seasonality.

**Objectives**

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

1.  Determine correlations between sales and returns.
2.  Identify high-return product categories and subcategories.
3.  Pinpoint geographical regions with significant return rates.
4.  Investigate seasonality trends affecting return rates.
5.  Provide actionable recommendations to stakeholders to reduce returns.
