Superstore Returns Analysis

EXEXCUTIVE SUMMARY

This analysis was created to determine what is causing the high number of returned orders at the superstore.  
The ultimate goal of this report is to help stakeholders understand what is causing customers to return their orders and 
how to reduce the volume of returned orders.  More specifically, we examined return rates by product category, geographical location 
and seasonality trends.  First, we determined whether or not there was a correlation between total sales and total returns.  
We aggregated this information based on product subcategories.  We show that sales do not always correlate positively with returns. 
Next, we evaluated the return rate based on subcategories. The relationship of the return rate was examined based on customer ID.  W
e also determined the geographical location of the biggest return centers for the superstore.  
After that, we wanted to determine if high returns could be attributed to seasonality trends.  
This was done by comparing the return rate based on month.  
Lastly, we explore seasonal trends to correlate between return rate and sales, and high return centers.  
Overall, without investigating customer feedback or reviews tied to returns and/or cross-referencing logistics data 
for shipping or inventory it is challenging to specifically pinpoint the explicit reason for high returns.  
It is highly possible it involves product-related issues, customer-related,  process-related, pricing issues or lenient return policies.

Overview
This project analyzes the high number of returned orders at a superstore to identify patterns, causes, 
and actionable recommendations to reduce return rates. 
Using data analytics, we explored return trends across product subcategories, geographical regions, customer profiles, and seasonality.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

Determine correlations between sales and returns.
Identify high-return product categories and subcategories.
Pinpoint geographical regions with significant return rates.
Investigate seasonality trends affecting return rates.
Provide actionable recommendations to stakeholders to reduce returns.

Key Insights and Recommendations


Correlation Between Sales and Returns
INSIGHT
Negative Correlations: Categories like accessories, art, bookcases, fasteners, machines, and supplies showed a disconnect between sales and returns.
Positive Correlations: Categories like appliances, chairs, and copiers demonstrated a higher return rate as sales increased.

Recommendations:
Improve quality and functionality for negatively correlated categories.
Address product durability and customer feedback for positively correlated categories.


High-Return Product Subcategories
INSIGHT
Top 3 Subcategories with Returns: Machines, fasteners, and chairs.
Lowest Return Subcategories: Art, labels, and envelopes.

Recommendations:
Investigate manufacturing issues in high-return subcategories.
Leverage low-return categories to build customer trust.


Geographical Analysis

INSIGHT
High-Return Regions: California, Utah, Oregon, and Washington.
Recommendations:
Focus quality control efforts on California and Washington.
Replicate Oregonâ€™s success factors in other regions.


Seasonality Trends

INSIGHT
Months with High Returns: August, September, October, and December.
Recommendations:
Enhance quality control and customer service during peak return months.
Implement targeted campaigns promoting low-return categories.


Tools and Technologies
